									<p>These are; Size, Colour, Resolution and Bleed. We have created a guide for each of these that explains exactly how to prepare your artwork to ensure that when you send to us, it’s ready for print. But don’t worry if you are not sure once you have finished, email the file to us and we will double check for you free of charge and let you know if there is anything wrong with the structure of the file.</p>
